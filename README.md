# Semantic Search API

The Semantic Search API provides an efficient and accurate way to search through your data using natural language queries. This API leverages advanced machine learning models to understand the context and semantics of your search queries, delivering relevant results with high precision.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understands and processes natural language queries.
- **Semantic Understanding:** Searches based on the meaning of the query, not just keyword matching.
- **Vector Embeddings:** Uses vector embeddings to represent data and queries in a high-dimensional space for better search accuracy.
- **Fast and Scalable:** Designed to handle large datasets with minimal latency.
